CatGT
=====

### What

CatGT is a postprocessing adjunct to SpikeGLX.

CatGT is a litteral Swiss Army knife that:

* TShifts data.
* Filters data.
* Common-average-references data.
* Removes artifacts.
* Concatenates files.
* Extracts TTL events, and more.

### Who

CatGT is developed by [Bill Karsh](https://www.janelia.org/people/bill-karsh)
of the [Tim Harris Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/harris-lab-apig) at
HHMI/Janelia Research Campus.

### Building in Windows

I build using Qt 5.12.0 (MinGW 64-bit). Compiled releases include the
app and supporting DLLs from that Qt version.

### Building in Linux

I build (under WSL2 on my Windows laptop) using ubuntu 16.04 and Qt
5.9.9 (MinGW 64-bit). Compiled releases include the app and supporting
DLLs from those versions of ubuntu and Qt, to make the package complete.
I build against old versions for (hopefully) better portability.
